            <h4>About The Artist.</h4>
            <p>Jeremy Wolff (@jwolffstudios) is a contemporary, pop, street artist from New York City, with a focus in current events, pop culture, sports, and music. Since taking on art full time in 2014, Wolff has been featured at multiple charity events, met a number of professional athletes that have signed his work, and has done live paintings. With a background in Mass Communications and Art, Wolff aims to gain a following, present at galleries, have murals on walls all over the world, and gain notoriety for his work. Wolff blends various styles to create a unique look that is beginning to transform into his own. Taking traditional oil painting portraits and mixing it with his often spray paint background and drip style painting, he blends a more modern look with a street/pop art feel.</p>
